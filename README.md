# Spotify-SQL-PROJECT-
## 🎵 Spotify Advanced SQL Project
### 📌 Analyzing Spotify tracks using SQL queries for data insights.

#### 📌 Overview
This project explores a Spotify dataset containing details about tracks, albums, and artists. The primary goal is to apply SQL queries for data extraction, aggregation, and pattern identification.

#### 🚀 Objectives
a.Explore and understand the dataset.

b.Perform SQL queries of varying complexity (easy & medium levels).

c.Derive insights using aggregation and joins.

#### 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

🎤 artist: The performer of the track.

🎵 track: The song name.

💽 album: The album name.

📊 album_type: Whether it’s a single or album.

🔥 danceability, energy, loudness, tempo: Track audio characteristics.

🎥 views, likes, comments: YouTube engagement metrics.

📡 streams: Spotify streaming data.

#### 🔍 Project Steps
##### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
a.Understand the dataset structure and attributes.
b.Identify key columns such as artist, track, album, danceability, energy, views, likes, etc.

##### 2️⃣ Database Setup & Schema Creation
a.Create a normalized database from a denormalized dataset.
b.Define a Spotify table with appropriate data types.
c.Insert sample data into the table for analysis.

##### 3️⃣ SQL Querying - Retrieving Insights
🔹 Easy Level Queries

a.Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.

b.List all albums along with their respective artists.

c.Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.

d.Find all tracks that belong to the album type ‘Single’.

e.Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

🔹 Medium Level Queries

a.Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.

b.Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.

c.List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.

d.For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.

e.Retrieve track names that have been streamed more on Spotify than YouTube.

#### 📈 Insights & Findings
a.🔥 Track Popularity: The most streamed track has over 1 billion plays.

b.🎧 Album Analysis: Some albums have higher engagement than singles.

c.📊 Energy & Danceability: Songs with higher energy tend to have more views.

d.📢 Streaming Trends: Some tracks perform better on Spotify than YouTube.

#### 🛠 Technology Stack
a.Database: PostgreSQL

b.SQL Tools: pgAdmin 4 / DBeaver

c.Query Types: Joins, Aggregations, Filtering, Grouping

#### 🎯 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL in analyzing music data, providing key insights into track popularity, engagement, and streaming trends.
