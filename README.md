# Spotify-SQL-PROJECT-
🎵 Spotify Advanced SQL Project
📌 Analyzing Spotify tracks using SQL queries for data insights.

📌 Overview
This project explores a Spotify dataset containing details about tracks, albums, and artists. The primary goal is to apply SQL queries for data extraction, aggregation, and pattern identification.

🚀 Objectives
Explore and understand the dataset.
Perform SQL queries of varying complexity (easy & medium levels).
Derive insights using aggregation and joins.
Create basic visualizations to represent key trends.

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

🎤 artist: The performer of the track.
🎵 track: The song name.
💽 album: The album name.
📊 album_type: Whether it’s a single or album.
🔥 danceability, energy, loudness, tempo: Track audio characteristics.
🎥 views, likes, comments: YouTube engagement metrics.
📡 streams: Spotify streaming data.

🔍 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Exploration
Understand the dataset structure and attributes.
Identify key columns such as artist, track, album, danceability, energy, views, likes, etc.

2️⃣ Database Setup & Schema Creation
Create a normalized database from a denormalized dataset.
Define a Spotify table with appropriate data types.
Insert sample data into the table for analysis.

3️⃣ SQL Querying - Retrieving Insights
🔹 Easy Level Queries
Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
List all albums along with their respective artists.
Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.
Find all tracks that belong to the album type ‘Single’.
Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

🔹 Medium Level Queries
Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.
For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
Retrieve track names that have been streamed more on Spotify than YouTube.

5️⃣ Next Steps
Perform advanced SQL optimization (Indexing, Query Execution Plan).
Expand dataset to analyze larger-scale streaming data.
Integrate with Tableau or Power BI for interactive dashboards.

📈 Insights & Findings
🔥 Track Popularity: The most streamed track has over 1 billion plays.
🎧 Album Analysis: Some albums have higher engagement than singles.
📊 Energy & Danceability: Songs with higher energy tend to have more views.
📢 Streaming Trends: Some tracks perform better on Spotify than YouTube.

🛠 Technology Stack
Database: PostgreSQL
SQL Tools: pgAdmin 4 / DBeaver
Query Types: Joins, Aggregations, Filtering, Grouping

🎯 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL in analyzing music data, providing key insights into track popularity, engagement, and streaming trends.
