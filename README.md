# Spotify-SQL-PROJECT-
🎵 Spotify Advanced SQL Project
📌 Analyzing Spotify tracks using SQL queries for data insights.

📌 Overview
This project explores a Spotify dataset containing details about tracks, albums, and artists. The primary goal is to apply SQL queries for data extraction, aggregation, and pattern identification.

🚀 Objectives
Explore and understand the dataset.
Perform SQL queries of varying complexity (easy & medium levels).
Derive insights using aggregation and joins.
Create basic visualizations to represent key trends.

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

🎤 artist: The performer of the track.
🎵 track: The song name.
💽 album: The album name.
📊 album_type: Whether it’s a single or album.
🔥 danceability, energy, loudness, tempo: Track audio characteristics.
🎥 views, likes, comments: YouTube engagement metrics.
📡 streams: Spotify streaming data.

🔍 Project Steps
1️⃣ Data Exploration
Before querying, an initial exploratory analysis was performed using:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM spotify LIMIT 10;
This helped us understand the data structure and potential patterns.

2️⃣ SQL Queries
📌 Easy Level Queries
✅ Retrieve track names with more than 1 billion streams:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT track, streams 
FROM spotify 
WHERE streams > 1000000000;
✅ List all albums with their respective artists:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT DISTINCT album, artist 
FROM spotify;
✅ Get the total comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT SUM(comments) AS total_comments 
FROM spotify 
WHERE licensed = TRUE;
✅ Find all tracks that belong to the album type = ‘single’:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT track, album 
FROM spotify 
WHERE album_type = 'single';
✅ Count the total number of tracks per artist:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT artist, COUNT(track) AS total_tracks 
FROM spotify 
GROUP BY artist 
ORDER BY total_tracks DESC;
📌 Medium Level Queries
✅ Calculate average danceability for each album:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT album, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability 
FROM spotify 
GROUP BY album;
✅ Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT track, energy 
FROM spotify 
ORDER BY energy DESC 
LIMIT 5;
✅ List all tracks with views and likes, where official video = TRUE:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT track, views, likes 
FROM spotify 
WHERE official_video = TRUE 
ORDER BY views DESC;
✅ Calculate total views per album:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT album, SUM(views) AS total_views 
FROM spotify 
GROUP BY album 
ORDER BY total_views DESC;
✅ Retrieve tracks where Spotify streams > YouTube views:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT track, streams, views 
FROM spotify 
WHERE streams > views;
📊 Data Visualization (Optional)
To enhance insights from SQL queries, we created simple visualizations using Tableau / Power BI / Matplotlib.

🔹 1. Most Streamed Tracks (Bar Chart)
Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT track, streams 
FROM spotify 
ORDER BY streams DESC 
LIMIT 10;
💡 Visualization Idea:

Bar Chart: Top 10 most streamed tracks (Y-axis: Streams, X-axis: Track Names).
Insight: Identifies the most popular songs based on Spotify streams.
🔹 2. Artist with Most Tracks (Pie Chart)
Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT artist, COUNT(track) AS total_tracks 
FROM spotify 
GROUP BY artist 
ORDER BY total_tracks DESC 
LIMIT 5;
💡 Visualization Idea:

Pie Chart: Proportion of tracks by top 5 artists.
Insight: Shows which artists have contributed the most songs to the dataset.
🔹 3. Views vs. Likes (Scatter Plot)
Query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT views, likes 
FROM spotify;
💡 Visualization Idea:

Scatter Plot: Each point represents a track, comparing views vs. likes.
Insight: Identifies whether higher views always lead to higher likes.
📈 Insights & Findings
🔥 Track Popularity: The most streamed track has over 1 billion plays.
🎧 Album Analysis: Some albums have higher engagement than singles.
📊 Energy & Danceability: Songs with higher energy tend to have more views.
📢 Streaming Trends: Some tracks perform better on Spotify than YouTube.
📈 Next Steps
✔️ Expanding Analysis: Adding more data to see trends over time.
✔️ Exploring Advanced Queries (Optional): Using window functions, CTEs, indexing for optimization.

🛠 Technology Stack
Database: PostgreSQL
SQL Tools: pgAdmin 4 / DBeaver
Query Types: Joins, Aggregations, Filtering, Grouping
Visualization: Tableau / Power BI / Matplotlib (Optional)
🎯 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL in analyzing music data, providing key insights into track popularity, engagement, and streaming trends.
